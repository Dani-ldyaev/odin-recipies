### Why the odin project

I just realised that I took on a task that might have been too much with frontend mentor, as I've not yet got a good grasps of the basics.
Here I am basically trying to learn HTML 5 and CSS to be able to use them and get a deeper understanding of how and why we do things the way they're done in those languages.
